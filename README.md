Predicting Stock Market Returns 
========

This repository contains the code for the portfolio project I'm working on at **Data Science Retreat** (Berlin).

The project aim is to build a model to predict **Stock Market prices**, using a combination of Machine Learning Algorithms.

The output of the prediction are the daily returns of S&P-500 index. I'm exploring two possible different problems:

* **Binary Classification Problem**: predict positive (**Up**) or negative (**Down**) return respect to the previous day.
* **Regression Problem**: predict the **exact return**; more useful to feed an hypothetical trading algorithm.

The language I picked to implement the analysis is Python (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit), although the first exploratory stuff has been done in R.

The main file is **Stocks.py**. The script calls several functions contained in the functions.py.

I'm actively working on the project meaning that the repo is going to be updated quite often.
